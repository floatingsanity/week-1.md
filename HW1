#You just wrote responses to these questions in Markdown. What even is that? What
is Markdown and how is it similar, different, or related to HTML?#

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format plain text documents. It is similar to HTML in that it allows you 
to structure and format text, but it is simpler and uses plain text to define formatting rather than using tags. Markdown is often 
used for writing documentation, README files, and other text-based content for the web. HTML, on the other hand, is a markup
language that uses tags and attributes to define the structure and content of web pages.

#What are 3 things you CAN NOT do in markdown that you CAN do in HTML?#

Create complex web page layouts: Markdown is primarily used for formatting text and does not provide the same level of control 
over page layout as HTML does.
Complex Layouts: Markdown is limited in creating complex page layouts. In HTML, you have full control over the structure and
positioning of elements.
Interactivity: HTML allows you to create interactive web pages with forms, buttons, and scripting (JavaScript), 
while Markdown focuses on content and presentation.
